# Example 3.6

It is proposed to serve a rectangular area of length 10,000 ft. and width of 6000 ft. The load density of the area is 2500 kVA/mile with a power factor of 0.9 lagging. The primary main feeder uses 336,400 26/7 ACSR on a pole configured as shown in Example 3.2. The question at hand is what minimum standard nominal voltage level can be used to serve this area without exceeding a voltage drop of 3% down the primary main? The choices of nominal voltages are 4.16 kV and 12.47 kV. Compute, also, the total three-phase power loss.
