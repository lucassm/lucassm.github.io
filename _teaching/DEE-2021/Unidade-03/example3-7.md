# Example 3.7

The triangular area shown in below is to be served by a feeder of nominal voltage 12.47 kV. The load density of the area is 3500 kVA/mile at a power factor of 0.9 lagging. The conductor on the primary main is 336,400 26/7 ACSR, and the configuration of the pole is that of Example 3.2.

Use the K drop factor from the line of Example 3.2 and determine the percent voltage drop from node n to node m.
