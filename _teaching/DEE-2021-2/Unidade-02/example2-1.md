# Example 2.1

A single-phase lateral provides service to three distribution transformers as shown in Figure 2.11. The energy in kWh consumed by each customer during a month is known. A load survey has been conducted for customers in this class, and it has been found that the customer 15-minute maximum kW demand is given by the equation:

$$
kW_{demand} = 0.2 + 0.008 \cdot kWh
$$

</div>

The kWh consumed by Customer #1 is 1523 kWh. The 15-minute maximum kW demand for Customer #1 is then computed as:

$$
kW_{1} = 0.2 + 0.008 ⋅ 1523 = 12.4
$$

The results of this calculation for the remainder of the customers is summarized below by transformer.

## Questões
1. Determine for each transformer the 15-minute noncoincident maximum kW demand and, using the Table of Diversity Factors in Table 2.2, determine the 15-minute maximum diversified kW demand.
2. Determine the 15-minute noncoincident maximum kW demand and 15-minute maximum diversified kW demand for each of the line segments.
