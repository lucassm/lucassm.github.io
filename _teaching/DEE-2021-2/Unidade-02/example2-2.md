# Example 2.2

Assume that the metered maximum diversified kW demand for the system of [Example 2.1](/teaching/DEE-2021-2/Unidade-02/example-2-1) is 92.9 kW. Allocate this load according to the kVA ratings of the three transformers:

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{T1} & = & 25 ~ kVA\\
S_{T2} & = & 37,5 ~ kVA\\
S_{T3} & = & 50 ~ kVA
\end{eqnarray}
$$
