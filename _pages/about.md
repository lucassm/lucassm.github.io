Hello, my name is Lucas Melo and I am Assistant Professor at the [Department of Electrical Engineering](http://www.dee.ufc.br) of [Federal University of Ceara (UFC)](http://www.ufc.br).

I am a colaborator of [UFC Smart Grid Group - GREI](https://grei-ufc.github.io/). My research interests are:
- Modeling and Simulation of Distributed Energetic Resourses (DER) Integration and Coordination in Electric Power Systems.
- Application of Optimization Techniques, Multiagent Systems and Co-simulation in Protection, Automation and Control of Electric Power Systems;
- Transactive Energy Systems.

## Teaching

I teach at BSc degree:

- [Electrical Distribution System Analysis](/teaching/DEE);
- [Electrical Transmission System Analysis](/teaching/TEE);
- [Eletrotecnic for Engineering](/teaching/EE);
- Computer Networks;
- [AC Circuits (Laboratory)](/teaching/CII-Lab);
- [DC Circuits (Laboratory)](/teaching/CI-Lab);
- [Eletrotecnic for Engineering (Laboratory)](/teaching/EE-Lab);
