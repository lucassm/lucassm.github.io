## About me

Assistant Professor at the [Department of Electrical Engineering](http://www.dee.ufc.br) of [Federal University of Ceara (UFC)](http://www.ufc.br). Colaborator of [UFC Smart Grid Group - GREI](https://grei-ufc.github.io/).

Degree in electrical engineering from UFC campus Sobral and master's and doctorate from UFC campus Fortaleza, with a sandwich internship at UFSC in Florianópolis.

Research topics interests:
- Modeling and Simulation of Distributed Energetic Resourses (DER) Integration and Coordination in Electric Power Systems;
- Application of Optimization Techniques, Multiagent Systems and Co-simulation in Protection, Automation and Control of Electric Power Systems;
- Transactive Energy Systems Development.

## News
