# Example 3.2

A three-phase line segment has the configuration as shown in Figure below. The spacings between conductors are:

$$
D_{ab} = 2.5 ft.\\
D_{bc} = 4.5 ft.\\
D_{ca} = 7.0 ft.
$$

The conductors of the line are 336,400 26/7 ACSR. Determine the positive sequence impedance of the line in ohms/mile.
