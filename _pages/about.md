Hi! My name is Lucas Melo and I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering of [Federal University of Ceara (UFC)](https://ufc.br). I teach Electrical Distribution System Analysis at BSc level and colaborate with [UFC Smart Grid Group - GREI](https://grei-ufc.github.io).

I am in a doctoral studies program under Dr. Ruth Le√£o (Federal University of Ceara) and Dr. Diego Issicaba (Federal University of Santa Catarina) supervision.

My research interests are in:
- Smart Grids applications;
- Multiagent systems;
- Optimization in electrical power systems;
- Power systems automation.

**Master Degree Dissertation**: Development of a platform for implementing multi-agents systems for application to automatic restoration of electric power distribution systems.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
