# Example 2.3

For the system of [Example 2.1](/teaching/DEE-2021-2/Unidade-02/example-2-1), assume the voltage at N1 is 2400 volts and compute the secondary voltages on the three transformers using the diversity factors. The system of [Example 2.1](/teaching/DEE-2021-2/Unidade-02/example-2-1), including segment distances, is shown in Figure below.

Assume that the power factor of the loads is 0.9 lagging.

The impedance of the lines are: z = 0.3 + j0.6 Ω/mile

The ratings of the transformers are:

$$
T1: ~ 25.0 kVA, ~ 2400-240 volts, ~ Z = 1.8 \angle 40^{\circ}\%\\
T2: ~ 37.5 kVA, ~ 2400-240 volts, ~ Z = 1.9 \angle 45^{\circ}\%\\
T3: ~ 50.0 kVA, ~ 2400-240 volts, ~ Z = 2.0 \angle 50^{\circ}\%
$$
